# NOTMonkeyTypeHacks-trust-
As the title says, it's not monkey type hacks dude, trust, also monkey type developers dont assasinate me. I'll delete this if you want to.

How To Use????? (Why So Bad)
1: Start the program.
2: When you hear a beep sound, means program has started.
3: Go to [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) and put your cursor in the top left of your text. (You have 5 seconds to do that)
4: Hear beep.
5: Now put your cursor on the down right of your text.
6: Hear beep again.
7: Now put your cursor on the second line of your text.
8: Ting sound happens.
9: Typing happens.
10: Wait till Ting sound happens again. (means program has stopped)
11: 👍👍👍

Bugs (Pls help fix me bad):
1: Absolutely breaks down when fast.
2: Wanted to do just one beep but can't remove first line.
3: That's all I can think for now :))))
